Sudoku Solver

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://sudoku-solver.freecodecamp.rocks/. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

    Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
    Use our Replit starter project to complete your project.
    Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.

    All puzzle logic can go into /controllers/sudoku-solver.js
        The validate function should take a given puzzle string and check it to see if it has 81 valid characters for the input.
        The check functions should be validating against the current state of the board.
        The solve function should handle solving any given valid puzzle string, not just the test inputs and solutions. You are expected to write out the logic to solve this.
    All routing logic can go into /routes/api.js
    See the puzzle-strings.js file in /controllers for some sample puzzles your application should solve
    To run the challenge tests on this page, set NODE_ENV to test without quotes in the .env file
    To run the tests in the console, use the command npm run test. To open the Replit console, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd if on a Mac) and type "open shell"

Write the following tests in tests/1_unit-tests.js:

    Logic handles a valid puzzle string of 81 characters
    Logic handles a puzzle string with invalid characters (not 1-9 or .)
    Logic handles a puzzle string that is not 81 characters in length
    Logic handles a valid row placement
    Logic handles an invalid row placement
    Logic handles a valid column placement
    Logic handles an invalid column placement
    Logic handles a valid region (3x3 grid) placement
    Logic handles an invalid region (3x3 grid) placement
    Valid puzzle strings pass the solver
    Invalid puzzle strings fail the solver
    Solver returns the expected solution for an incomplete puzzle

Write the following tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js

    Solve a puzzle with valid puzzle string: POST request to /api/solve
    Solve a puzzle with missing puzzle string: POST request to /api/solve
    Solve a puzzle with invalid characters: POST request to /api/solve
    Solve a puzzle with incorrect length: POST request to /api/solve
    Solve a puzzle that cannot be solved: POST request to /api/solve
    Check a puzzle placement with all fields: POST request to /api/check
    Check a puzzle placement with single placement conflict: POST request to /api/check
    Check a puzzle placement with multiple placement conflicts: POST request to /api/check
    Check a puzzle placement with all placement conflicts: POST request to /api/check
    Check a puzzle placement with missing required fields: POST request to /api/check
    Check a puzzle placement with invalid characters: POST request to /api/check
    Check a puzzle placement with incorrect length: POST request to /api/check
    Check a puzzle placement with invalid placement coordinate: POST request to /api/check
    Check a puzzle placement with invalid placement value: POST request to /api/check
