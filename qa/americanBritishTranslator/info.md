American British Translator

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://american-british-translator.freecodecamp.rocks/. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

    Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
    Use our Replit starter project to complete your project.
    Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.

    All logic can go into /components/translator.js
    Complete the /api/translate route in /routes/api.js
    Create all of the unit/functional tests in tests/1_unit-tests.js and tests/2_functional-tests.js
    See the JavaScript files in /components for the different spelling and terms your application should translate
    To run the tests on Replit, set NODE_ENV to test without quotes in the .env file
    To run the tests in the console, use the command npm run test. To open the Replit console, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd if on a Mac) and type "open shell"
